To give\n          players the option to enjoy the entire collection without purchasing\n          every game individually, we introduced a multi-app subscription. This\n          subscription unlocks all games and can be purchased in each individual\n          app.\n        </p>\n\n        <ul className=\"tag-clouds pt-5 pb-5\">\n          <li>Subscription</li>\n          <li>E-Commerce</li>\n          <li>UX Design</li>\n          <li>UI Design</li>\n          <li>Mobile</li>\n          <li>Scrum</li>\n          <li>A/B-Testing</li>\n          <li>Sketch</li>\n          <li>Trigger-Points</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <h2 className=\"text-uppercase font-weight-bold\">My Contributions</h2>\n        <p>\n          When I joined this project, my biggest challenge was to get the user\n          to understand the subscription. Technically it was all set up, but\n          communication with the user needed a lot of work still.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          First I worked on the communication at paywalls and for in-app\n          purchase billing. I’ve designed and AB-tested new paywalls to optimize\n          the user’s understanding of the existence of multiple games similar to\n          their liking.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          At that point the ‘happy scenario’ up and running, but what if\n          something would go wrong? I started creating screens to inform the\n          user if their status was in grace or when their subscription got\n          suspended or cancelled due to payment issues.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          With the basic flow correctly working, I moved on to creating special\n          offers. With some help, I was able to show a unique offer to every\n          user that had purchased any of our games in the last 3 months. I set\n          up a 30-day subscription trial so that every player that had once\n          bought one of our games could experience the entire catalog for free.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"gallery container-fluid px-md-5\">\n        <div className=\"row\">\n          <div className=\"col-12 col-md-6 mb-4\">\n            <img\n              src=\"/subscriptionpage-item1.png\"\n              alt=\"Multi app subscription\"\n              className=\"w-100\"\n            />\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"col-12 col-md-6 mb-4\">\n            <img\n              src=\"/subscriptionpage-item2.png\"\n              alt=\"Multi app subscription\"\n              className=\"w-100\"\n            />\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"col-12 col-md-6 mb-4\">\n            <img\n              src=\"/subscriptionpage-item3.png\"\n              alt=\"Multi app subscription\"\n              className=\"w-100\"\n            />\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"col-12 col-md-6 mb-4\">\n            <img\n              src=\"/subscriptionpage-item4.png\"\n              alt=\"Multi app subscription\"\n              className=\"w-100\"\n            />\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"col-12 col-md-6 mb-4\">\n            <img\n              src=\"/subscriptionpage-item5.png\"\n              alt=\"Multi app subscription\"\n              className=\"w-100\"\n            />\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </Layout>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default MultiAppSubscription;\n"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAKA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AACA;AACA;AAHA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAMA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAQA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAKA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAMA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAMA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAQA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AACA;AACA;AAHA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAMA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AACA;AACA;AAHA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAMA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AACA;AACA;AAHA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAMA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AACA;AACA;AAHA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAMA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AACA;AACA;AAHA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAUA;AACA;AACA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
