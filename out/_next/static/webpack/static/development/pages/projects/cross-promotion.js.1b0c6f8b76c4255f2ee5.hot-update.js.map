This was one of my first\n          projects at GameHouse. It has improved step by step and is still up\n          and running.\n        </p>\n        <ul className=\"tag-clouds pt-4 pb-4\">\n          <li>Subscription</li>\n          <li>E-Commerce</li>\n          <li>UX Design</li>\n          <li>UI Design</li>\n          <li>Mobile</li>\n          <li>Scrum</li>\n          <li>A/B-Testing</li>\n          <li>Sketch</li>\n          <li>Trigger-Points</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h2 className=\"text-uppercase font-weight-bold\">My Contributions</h2>\n        <p>\n          As part of one of GameHouse’s scrum teams, I worked on in-game cross\n          promotion. For this project we used a dynamic trigger-point system\n          created by another team. With this system we were able to load light\n          web-templates that we could use for additional communication with\n          players in the game.\n        </p>\n        ​\n        <p>\n          As the UX Designer of this scrum team I designed many different\n          templates. Templates then were AB-tested to determine which ones\n          worked best. We created a system to determine which template to show\n          in which game. First we manually switched between the dynamically\n          set-up templates. Later, a recommendation system was implemented to\n          automatically optimize the use templates per game.\n        </p>\n        ​\n        <p>\n          The results of this project are still up and running. I used many\n          different tools for this project. In the beginning of this project I\n          mainly used Photoshop, Illustrator and Axure. Later I moved to\n          Adobe-XD and eventually Sketch.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"container pb-5\">\n        <div className=\"row\">\n          <div className=\"col-12 col-md-6 mb-4\">\n            <img\n              src=\"/crosspromotionpage-item1.png\"\n              alt=\"Cross Promotion\"\n              className=\"w-100\"\n            />\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"col-12 col-md-6 mb-4\">\n            <img\n              src=\"/crosspromotionpage-item2.png\"\n              alt=\"Cross Promotion\"\n              className=\"w-100\"\n            />\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"col-12 col-md-6 mb-4\">\n            <img\n              src=\"/crosspromotionpage-item3.png\"\n              alt=\"Cross Promotion\"\n              className=\"w-100\"\n            />\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"col-12 col-md-6 mb-4\">\n            <img\n              src=\"/crosspromotionpage-item4.png\"\n              alt=\"Cross Promotion\"\n              className=\"w-100\"\n            />\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </Layout>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default CrossPromotion;\n"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAKA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AACA;AACA;AAHA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAMA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAMA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAQA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AASA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAOA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AACA;AACA;AAHA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAMA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AACA;AACA;AAHA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAMA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AACA;AACA;AAHA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAMA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AACA;AACA;AAHA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAUA;AACA;AACA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
