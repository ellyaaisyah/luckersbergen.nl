My name is Luc Kersbergen. I’m an{\" \"}\n          <strong>allround UX/UI designer</strong> who is used to working in\n          fast moving and constantly adapting scrum teams. I believe in a “fail\n          fast, succeed sooner” mentality. People describe me as an{\" \"}\n          <strong>seasy-going team player</strong> with an{\" \"}\n          <strong>eye for detail</strong>. I love to come up with multiple\n          solutions that can be tested for the ultimate result.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          During my time at GameHouse I’ve been part of multiple scrum teams,\n          responsible for <strong>mobile projects</strong> like{\" \"}\n          <strong>in-game cross-promotion</strong>, multi-app subscription and a{\" \"}\n          <strong>games catalog app</strong>.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          As a UX/UI designer, I have been working on creating new ideas,\n          wire-framing, designing, prototyping and testing for our projects.\n          Through the years, I’ve used multiple tools like Photoshop,\n          Illustrator, Axure and Adobe XD. Currently, I mainly use Sketch to\n          visualise flows, designs and prototypes.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </Layout>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default AboutMe;\n"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAUA;AACA;AACA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
