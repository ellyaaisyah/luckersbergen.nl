My name is Luc Kersbergen. I’m an{\" \"}\n          <strong>allround UX/UI designer</strong> who is used to working in\n          fast moving and constantly adapting scrum teams. I believe in a “fail\n          fast, succeed sooner” mentality. People describe me as an{\" \"}\n          <strong>seasy-going team player</strong> with an{\" \"}\n          <strong>eye for detail</strong>. I love to come up with multiple\n          solutions that can be tested for the ultimate result.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          During my time at GameHouse I’ve been part of multiple scrum teams,\n          responsible for <strong>mobile projects</strong> like{\" \"}\n          <strong>in-game cross-promotion</strong>, multi-app subscription and a{\" \"}\n          <strong>games catalog app</strong>.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          As a UX/UI designer, I have been working on creating new ideas,\n          wire-framing, designing, prototyping and testing for our projects.\n          Through the years, I’ve used multiple tools like Photoshop,\n          Illustrator, Axure and Adobe XD. Currently, I mainly use Sketch to\n          visualise flows, designs and prototypes.\n        </p>\n\n        <div className=\"pt-5 pb-5\">\n          <hr />\n        </div>\n\n        <h2 className=\"text-uppercase font-weight-bold mb-5\">My Experience</h2>\n\n        <div className=\"exp mb-5\">\n          <h4>\n            <strong>UX / UI Designer, GameHouse</strong>\n          </h4>\n\n          <p>\n            2016 - 2019 | After graduating from Avans University I started\n            working at GameHouse as a mobile UX/UI Designer. After finishing a\n            project for a recruiting website/system and a catalog app for their\n            games I got hired permanently. In the years to come I improved my\n            UX-UI skills in agile projects like a multi-app subscription model,\n            in-game cross-promotion and a mobile app focused on the game\n            catalog. These projects all used scrum to make quick iterations\n            possible.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"exp mb-5\">\n          <h4>\n            <strong>UX Designer, Graduation internship, GameHouse</strong>\n          </h4>\n\n          <p>\n            2015 - 2016 | I did a graduation project at GameHouse in Eindhoven.\n            This project was about setting up a website where future employees\n            could find out about the company’s culture and could apply for a\n            job. Also a recruiting system got attached so the company’s\n            recruiter could manage the applicants.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"exp mb-5\">\n          <h4>\n            <strong>Web Designer, Marconcepts</strong>\n          </h4>\n\n          <p>\n            2014 - 2014 | After a 5 month internship I continued working in the\n            summer period for Marconcept, an online web developing company\n            specialised in SEO.
